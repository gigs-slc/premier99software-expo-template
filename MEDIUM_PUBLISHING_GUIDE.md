# How to Publish the Medium Article

## Step-by-Step Publishing Process

### 1. Copy the Article Content

Open `MEDIUM_ARTICLE.md` and copy everything **except** the first two lines (title and logo).

### 2. Create New Story on Medium

1. Go to [medium.com](https://medium.com)
2. Click **"Write"** in the top right
3. You'll see a blank story editor

### 3. Add the Title

Paste the title:
```
Building a Production-Ready React Native/Expo Template: A Modern Approach
```

### 4. Add the Logo

1. Click the **"+"** button on the left side of the editor
2. Select **"Image"**
3. Upload: `/Users/griffinhuth/Downloads/1_lSUxUafv97sJCMFpId56nQ.webp`
4. Click the **center alignment** button to center it

### 5. Add the Subtitle

Paste the subtitle below the logo:
```
Stop wasting hours setting up every new React Native project. Here's how I built a reusable template that saves me days of work.
```

### 6. Paste the Rest of the Article

Copy everything from `MEDIUM_ARTICLE.md` starting from:
```
Every React Native developer knows the pain...
```

Paste it into Medium below the subtitle.

### 7. Format Code Blocks

Medium won't automatically format code blocks. For each code block:

**Method 1 - Keyboard Shortcut (Fastest):**
1. Select the code text (everything between ` ```bash ` or ` ```typescript `)
2. Press: **`Cmd + Option + 6`** (Mac) or **`Ctrl + Alt + 6`** (Windows)
3. Delete the ` ```bash ` and ` ``` ` markers

**Method 2 - Toolbar:**
1. Select the code text
2. Click the **`< >`** button in the toolbar that appears
3. Delete the ` ```bash ` and ` ``` ` markers

**You'll need to do this for approximately 20-25 code blocks in the article.**

### 8. Format Inline Code

For inline code like `isAuthenticated` or `storage.set()`:
1. Select the text
2. Press backtick **`** once (or use toolbar's code button)

### 9. Add Images (Optional)

If you want to add screenshots:
1. Click **"+"** where you want the image
2. Select **"Image"**
3. Upload your screenshot
4. Add a caption if needed

### 10. Add Tags

At the bottom of the article, add these tags:
- `React Native`
- `Expo`
- `Mobile Development`
- `Software Development`
- `Template Creation`

### 11. Preview

Click **"Preview"** in the top right to see how it looks.

### 12. Publish Settings

Click **"Publish"** when ready:
1. **Story Preview:** Make sure title and subtitle look good
2. **Publishing to:** Select your publication if you have one
3. **Add or change topics:** Keep the tags you added
4. **Schedule for later:** Optional

### 13. Publish!

Click **"Publish now"**

## Quick Formatting Reference

### Headers

Medium uses these header sizes:
- Title = H1 (only use once at top)
- `##` = H2 (main sections)
- `###` = H3 (subsections)

### Text Formatting

- **Bold**: Select text, click **B** or use `**text**`
- *Italic*: Select text, click *I* or use `*text*`
- `Code`: Select text, click `< >` or press backtick
- [Link](url): Select text, click link icon

### Lists

Medium auto-formats lists when you start with:
- `-` for bullet points
- `1.` for numbered lists

### Blockquotes

Start a line with `>` for quotes:
> This becomes a blockquote

### Dividers

Use `---` on its own line for a horizontal divider

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Code blocks look like regular text

**Fix:** You need to manually format each code block with `Cmd + Option + 6`

### Issue: Inline code not formatted

**Fix:** Select the code text and press backtick ` or use the code button

### Issue: Headers too big/small

**Fix:**
- Use `##` for main sections (H2)
- Use `###` for subsections (H3)
- Don't use `#` (that's the title)

### Issue: Lists not formatting

**Fix:** Make sure there's a blank line before the list starts

### Issue: Logo not centered

**Fix:** Click the image, then click the center alignment button in the toolbar

## Pro Tips

2. **Format as you paste** - Do each section instead of pasting everything at once
3. **Use the preview** often to check formatting
4. **Save draft** frequently (Medium auto-saves, but good to check)
5. **Read it through** one more time before publishing
